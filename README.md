I am passionate :heart: about DevOps & Platform Engineering / Automation / Linux :penguin: / Systems Engineering / Kubernetes / Cloud Computing / Anything Open Source / Security. I love coding in Python :snake: / Bash :shell: and JavaScript. Lately, I'm also exploring Machine Learning and Deep Learning and have graduated from [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 

When I'm not coding or creating awesome stuff I'm building games [like this one](https://ghimire.github.io/games/little/), making music or having a pint of :beer:. Among other things, I also enjoy :sunny: :evergreen_tree: :mount_fuji: :ocean: :running: :palm_tree: :tent:.
